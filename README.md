Hello, I'm Joshua Sandman, a driven and self-motivated individual with a strong passion for cybersecurity and a growing expertise in penetration testing.
Although I don't have a traditional college background, I've been dedicated to learning and upskilling through online courses and certifications.
My journey in computer science has led me to develop an obsession for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to get my foot in the door and transition into this field, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact.
